Paneer (Indian cottage cheese): Paneer is a super soft, fresh, un-aged Indian cottage cheese, usually made from dairy milk. You can use ricotta cheese if needed instead of paneer, but itâ€™s important to note that ricotta cheese may be salted and paneer is not. Squeeze and drain any extra whey from ricotta before using.

Vegetables: You will need fresh or frozen green peas (matar), a few medium-sized ripe red tomatoes, a medium or large onion, and some green chilies.

Cashews: Cashews act as a creamy thickener for the masala paste. However, if you do not have cashews on hand, you can substitute almonds.

Seasonings: You will need several seasonings and spices for this mutter paneer recipe, including cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, salt, ginger, garlic, coriander leaves and seeds, black peppercorns, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon.
